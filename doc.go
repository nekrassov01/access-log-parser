// Package parser provides utilities to read and parse logs from various inputs (standard input, plain text, gzip, zip)
// and convert them to structured formats such as JSON and LTSV. It is simple yet sophisticated, filtering by labels,
// extracting rows by filter expressions, aggregating results, and applying custom conversion functions.
